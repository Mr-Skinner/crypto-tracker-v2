## CryptoTracker v2

## Opener
Taking my app CryptoTracker and re-building from stratch with what I've been learning recently. 

## Goals
Can I make this app more efficent, better designed, mobile friendly and maybe even more complex.

## Method
I'll be using Tailwind CSS to build the app from the group up mobile first, later configuring layouts for larger displays. I'm encorporating TypeScript to ensure type-safety across my components and clarity over what's expected where. Previously in this build I'd used axios for the CoinGecko API call, this time I want to try using React Query and enable caching.
